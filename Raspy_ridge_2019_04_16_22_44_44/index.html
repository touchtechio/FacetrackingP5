Who - shrine

You have touched our lives in immeasurable ways and we’ll forever be grateful and want you to be apart of our family.

Why - unicorn

We don’t tend to make a fuss about our relationship but we really wanted to take a pause to celebrate.

Our coming together has not been a coincidence but shaped by the wonderful people in our lives - you! Therefore this celebration could not be complete without you.


Why Wokyo? - mountain

Many people fantasize about going to Japan, we are such people.

We have to get very far away from all our computers.

You have touched our lives in immeasurable ways and we’ll forever be grateful and want you to be apart of our family.
