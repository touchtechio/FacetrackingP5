You have touched our lives in immeasurable ways and we’ll forever be grateful and want you to be apart of our family.

Why - unicorn

We don’t tend to make a fuss about our relationship but we really wanted to take a pause to celebrate.

Our coming together has not been a coincidence but shaped by the wonderful people in our lives - you! Therefore this celebration could not be complete without you.


Why Wokyo? - mountain

Many people fantasize about going to Japan, we are such people.

We have to get very far away from all our computers.
